This is an app to convert Kindle vocab file so that it can be imported into Anki. There are some alternatives, but this is the only Web-based version. There is no need to install anything. And it should be usable from the Kindle itself.

Alternatives:
* https://github.com/prz3m/kind2anki - anki addon, but not customizable
* https://fluentcards.com/kindle - nice interface, split by books, can export base sentence or cloze deletion, but not all words are translated
* https://github.com/NdYAG/Kindle2Anki - need to install npm
* https://github.com/wzyboy/kindle_vocab_anki - allows to create templates for the cards, but it requires using Python in command line and requires a lot of steps
* Kindlemate - great, but windows only
good:
bad: windows only
